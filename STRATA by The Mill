The Mill is a VFX firm currently exploring new ways of experiencing immersive VR technologies (among other disciplines) 

Their proposed project STRATA consists of a VR environments that react and generate based on the users physiological and neurological data.

Biometric sensors measure EEG (brainwaves), GSR (stress levels), heart rate, and breathing. 
These reactions are measured by a conductive band that The Mill has developed.

They have a special lap “pillow” that collects GSR and heart rate.(shows there are other ways of collecting  GSR data rather than 2 finger sensors we were looking at.)

Data from the sensors gets sent to an app, which is sent to the HMD.

The mills  goal for this experience is to sooth the individual. The more relaxed they become the more the  environment will change.

Heres a video of it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDolBnuDg4Y
I haven’t found footage of anyone using it yet so not sure what the biometric band or pillow set up looks like. Tad skeptical at this point.
But apparently there was an on stage demonstration. Yet to find footage of it yet
