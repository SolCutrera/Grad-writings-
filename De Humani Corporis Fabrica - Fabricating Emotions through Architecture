De Humani Corporis Fabrica - Fabricating Emotions through Architecture was an experiment undertaken by four subjects to measure the emotional experience of  a 1:1 scale architectural settings. 
 
The experiment was part of a larger Phd program exploring ideas of the human embodiment in space. Referencing ancient architectural texts such as Vitruvius.

Participants were asked to perform a simple task in a 1:1 architectural setting (working at a desk, eating a meal)  and then alter the design parameters of the setting and perform the task again. 

The participants were results were recorded through a combined use of biometric technology,
a Presence Questionnaire (Witmer and Singer 1995) and a SAM (Bradley et al. 1994) chart.

The experiment was designed considering four main stages 
identifying design characteristics that will get sensory reaction from participants
Construct an architectural setting to exemplify sensory reactions
record  participants interaction with the setting through the three methods stated above 
analyse the data and differentiate between compelling and non compelling

Results supported the hypothesis that participants emotional response to design objects can be measured objectively through emotive readings 

The research highlighted that biometric technology is a valuable method for identifying emotive spikes. Due to issues with the stability of the biometric recordings however, the results were left our of the paper.
